Investigates neural basis for frog muscle synergies using Stochastic Dynamical Operators

A muscle synergy is a group of muscles that are activated together. They are theorized to be the fundamental building blocks of more complex movements.  For example, straightening the knee would be a muscle synergy that is needed for walking. 

Motor pools are groups of single motor units. We observe that the activity of motor pools, though only physically innervating one muscle, correlates strongly with the activity of other muscles. This correlated muscle activity is called a muscle synergy. 

As a result, interneurons are hypothesized to be the biological basis for the observation of muscle synergies. When one interneuron is activated, it activates a group of muscles in order to create a simple motor output. For clarity, the primary alternative to this hypothesis would be that individual motor pools are recruited in a task dependent manner rather than by a physical interneuron.
